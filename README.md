# SWUChromeExtension
Made during our company HackDay at Sendwithus (SWU).

Replaces words starting or that have the 2nd letter as the letter u with 'swu'. Updates -> Swupdates.

If you'd like to try it out, copy the repo and open it in the extensions section of Chrome with `Load unpacked extension`
